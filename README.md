# Receipt Management for Google Wallet

## The Challenge
Google Wallet provides fast, secure access to everyday essentials, but managing physical receipts is still cumbersome. Users often lose records, struggle to track expenses, and miss out on leveraging purchase data for personal benefit. There is a clear need for a seamless way to digitize, organize, and utilize receipt information directly within Google Wallet, enabling users to gain valuable insights into their spending habits and optimize their financial management.

## The Objective
Build "Project Raseed," an AI-powered personal assistant that acts as a comprehensive receipt manager and financial advisor for everyday users. This assistant provides actionable intelligence, enabling users to easily track expenses, gain insights into spending, and identify opportunities for savings‚Äîall tightly integrated with Google Wallet.

### Key Capabilities
- **Multimodal Receipt Ingestion and Analysis**: Accepts photos, videos, or live streams of receipts in any language. Uses Gemini‚Äôs multimodal AI to analyze media, extract items, values, taxes, and fees, and stores this information. Passes are generated for Google Wallet, with detailed items and links back to the assistant for more info.
- **Local Language Query and Pass Generation**: Users can ask questions or make requests in their local language (e.g., "What can I cook with the food I bought last week?"). The agent, built with Vertex AI Agent Builder, responds and can generate Google Wallet passes (e.g., shopping lists) with actionable details.
- **Spending Analysis and Savings Suggestions**: The agent answers queries about spending (e.g., "How much did I spend on groceries last month?") using Gemini to analyze trends and suggest savings. Insights are shared as updatable passes in Google Wallet, and push notifications are sent for important changes.
- **Seamless Google Wallet API Integration**: Direct integration with the Google Wallet API to programmatically create, update, and push customized passes to the user's wallet.

## üöÄ Workflow & Execution Plan

### 1. Uploading the Receipt
- Users upload receipt images or videos via web or mobile.
- Files are securely stored in **Firebase Storage**.

### 2. Parsing the Receipt with Gemini
- **Gemini multimodal AI** (via Firebase Functions) extracts all details: items, prices, taxes, totals, store name, etc., in any language.
- Structured data is generated for each receipt.

### 3. Saving and Structuring the Data
- Parsed data is stored in:
  - **Firestore** (structured receipt records)
  - **Vertex Vector DB** (embedded text for fast, intelligent search)
- Each receipt is associated with user, timestamp, merchant, categories, and spend.

### 4. Adding the Receipt to Google Wallet
- A **Google Wallet Pass** is created for each receipt, summarizing store, amount, and items.
- Passes include a link to the full receipt on the Firebase-hosted web app.
- Passes are grouped by purchase time (today, week, month).

### 5. Agents Built Using Genkit
- **Retriever Agent**: Pulls relevant receipts from the Vector DB.
- **Query Agent**: Handles user questions ("What did I buy last week?") and generates responses with Gemini.
- **Formatter Agent**: Formats and delivers responses in-app or to Wallet passes.
- Agents collaborate for real-time, context-aware financial assistance.

### 6. Intelligent Suggestions in the Background
- Background processes analyze spending, trends, and suggest ways to save.
- Suggestions are shown in the dashboard and as a "Smart Tip" pass in Google Wallet.

### 7. Visual Dashboard for Receipts and Analytics
- Users can:
  - View full receipts and item lists
  - See spending breakdowns by category
  - Explore graphs and trends
  - Access suggestions and tips
- Dashboard is Firebase-hosted and linked from Wallet passes.

### 8. Multilingual Support for Queries
- Users interact with the AI assistant in their preferred language (Hindi, Marathi, etc. via Gemini).

### 9. Personal Chat Assistant with Context Awareness
- Smart chat interface answers queries like:
  - "Am I overspending on groceries?"
  - "What were my top purchases this week?"
- Uses Gemini and data from Firestore/Vector DB for personalized answers.

### 10. Receipt Management Tools
- Agents help users:
  - Filter by value, category, or merchant
  - Delete or manage receipts

### 11. Pattern Analysis and Push Notifications
- Agents detect spending patterns and send push notifications (via Firebase Cloud Messaging) for spikes or trends.
- Notifications link back to the dashboard for deeper insights.

### 12. Agent Orchestration with Vertex AI
- **AI Orchestrator** (Vertex AI Agent Builder or Genkit Flow API) decides which agents to trigger and how to compose responses.
- Enables multi-turn, modular, and scalable interactions.
